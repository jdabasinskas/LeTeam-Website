            The topic I am most curious about is cybersecurity. With the ever-evolving technological cloud, cybersecurity importance has continued to grow, and it is intriguing to see how it will evolve. This seems to be a constant battle with the evolution of hacking and different methods that always seem to pop up.  
            To me, it feels like a constant tug-of-war game with cybersecurity and hacking, both taking turns developing and changing. Hackers continue to find different ways to exploit or encrypt parts of the internet, whether that be large corporations, small colleges, or worldwide businesses, hacking is a constant issue that all people are prone to. In this class, Dr. Dang showed us the dangers of public Wi-Fi and how hackers can easily get access to all your phones information based on the packets that a user may be sending and the inputs that they are doing. It made me much more conscious of what networks I now connect to, as it can be as easy as a few clicks for some hackers to get all of my bank information, social security, address, and other personal information. That sort of hacking is just surface level, one that takes little effort and has minimal damage compared to the grand scheme of things.  
            Seeing how Microsoft can get hacked on a worldwide scale, colleges can be held ransom, and all the credit card numbers of users on a certain online shopping website, cybersecurity needs to be at the forefront of businesses everywhere. The development of the field into businesses has been crural and needs to be implemented everywhere, no matter the business. 
            However, this is only possible if more colleges offer cybersecurity programs that people can go down. Each year, more and more colleges implement cybersecurity concentrations into their computer science programs, and to me, it is the most important thing that the field can be doing for the future. Allowing students to study strictly cybersecurity will grow the pool for businesses to hire very qualified and knowledgeable people within IT departments, and the more people study it, the bigger the pool is, and the more businesses are able to implement a cybersecurity branch that fosters people with a degree in that field. 
            In conclusion, cybersecurity is an essential aspect of our digital lives, protecting us from the ever-present threat of cyberattacks. As technology continues to advance, so too must our efforts to secure our information systems. By staying vigilant, investing in more security measures, and fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness, we can safeguard the digital frontier and ensure a safer online environment for all.

            Breckin Miller:
            When learning about MIS this semester, I found cloud computing to be the most interesting topic that we went over. Specifically, I found it interesting when considering how technology can help a business be more efficient. Cloud computing can make a company more effective in many ways while increasing its data safety. Cloud computing allows companies or individuals to recover data lost on local computers or storage devices if lost. It also has several layers of encryption to keep the data as secure as possible while still making it accessible to the user. 

 

One of the main ways that it makes companies more efficient is its accessibility and its capacity. Accessibility is arguably the most important trait for companies that never stop working. It allows for data to be accessed anywhere in the world as long as there is an internet connection which is extremely helpful to people who travel a lot. Recently this has become even more important due to the pandemic and a large increase in remote work. Without cloud computing, the pandemic would have affected our lives in a much different way. The only reason that we were able to connect with each other or still do our jobs during the pandemic was cloud computing. It became almost vital to our lives during this time and to this day it really has not left. It also allows for an easier way to work with people which in today’s age of learning is extremely important. For example, this class alone would not be possible without the use of cloud computing. 

 

Another very important aspect of cloud computing is its scale. It is vital for modern businesses and individuals, as it ensures that resources can be adjusted dynamically to meet fluctuating demands. It also is a much easier way to scale a business or personal storage up or down unlike traditional IT infrastructures. It is much cheaper as well which allows for flexibility of the user to only pay for what they use. Scalability is particularly crucial for businesses experiencing rapid growth, seasonal spikes, or unpredictable workloads. Ultimately, scalability ensures agility, cost-effectiveness, and resilience in today’s fast-paced digital landscape. Essentially it just makes computers more efficient and safer for users.

 

Cloud computing is vital in today’s age and has fundamentally changed how our world operates. Its ability to securely store and retrieve data, even in challenging circumstances, ensures continuity and resilience which is necessary for many people around the world. Businesses today would not be able to perform the tasks they do at the efficiency they do without the aid of cloud computing. The pandemic highlighted its critical role, enabling work, learning, and communication to continue uninterrupted. Along with its affordability and scalability, cloud computing is one of our most powerful tools when it comes to our business or personal uses.

        Jonathan Dabasinskas: Cloud computing has revolutionized the way we think about and interact with technology, becoming a cornerstone of modern business and personal computing. It offers a compelling alternative to traditional on-premise infrastructures, making it an area of immense interest and potential for exploration.

        At its core, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. These services range from storage and processing power to software applications and even artificial intelligence tools. The allure of cloud computing lies in its scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. Instead of investing heavily in physical hardware or data centers, individuals and organizations can leverage the cloud to access resources on-demand, paying only for what they use. This shift not only reduces capital expenditure but also enables businesses to respond quickly to changes in demand or market conditions.
        
        One of the most fascinating aspects of cloud computing is its scalability. For example, a startup might begin by utilizing basic cloud storage and a few virtual machines. As the business grows, it can effortlessly scale its resources to handle increased traffic or data processing needs. This elasticity is particularly beneficial for companies operating in unpredictable environments, where sudden spikes in demand could overwhelm traditional IT infrastructures.
        
        Another compelling feature is the global reach of cloud platforms. Providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud have data centers worldwide, enabling users to deploy applications closer to their customers. This geographic distribution reduces latency, improves performance, and enhances the user experience. Additionally, the cloud’s ability to support remote work has been transformative, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. By hosting applications and data in the cloud, teams can collaborate seamlessly from anywhere, breaking down geographical barriers and fostering a new era of flexibility.
        
        Cloud computing also fosters innovation by democratizing access to advanced technologies. Machine learning models, big data analytics, and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms are no longer exclusive to tech giants; they are available to anyone with a cloud subscription. This accessibility empowers startups, researchers, and even students to experiment and create solutions that were once unimaginable.
        
        Despite its advantages, cloud computing raises critical questions about data security and privacy. Storing sensitive information on third-party servers requires trust in the provider’s ability to safeguard data against breaches or unauthorized access. While cloud providers implement robust security measures, the shared responsibility model places some of the burden on users to ensure proper configurations and practices. This dual responsibility underscores the importance of understanding the nuances of cloud security.
        
        Another challenge is the potential for vendor lock-in. Organizations that heavily integrate with a specific provider’s tools may find it difficult to switch platforms later, leading to dependency issues. Awareness and strategic planning are essential to mitigate these risks.
        
        As I delve deeper into cloud computing, I am struck by its transformative potential. It is not just a technological advancement; it is a paradigm shift that changes how we approach problem-solving, innovation, and collaboration. From the way it enables startups to scale rapidly to how it empowers global collaboration, cloud computing is an area ripe for exploration and growth. The future promises even more exciting developments, such as edge computing and hybrid clouds, which blend on-premise and cloud solutions to offer the best of both worlds.
        
        In conclusion, cloud computing represents a dynamic and ever-evolving field that captures my imagination. Its ability to transform industries, empower individuals, and drive innovation is both inspiring and exciting. I look forward to exploring its applications further and understanding how it can shape the future of technology.

        Dillon Hartman: I am most curious about taking user information, input, and advice and using it to create a more effective product. At the beginning of this semester Dr. Dang showed us a map of Vietnam with marks on the population of a certain area that were using a certain software. These people were able to take pictures of their town and posting it to a forum to request a change in their community. Services that the citizens were posting about ranged from topics such as landscaping, road conditions, street signs, and more.
I think allowing inputs from the participants and users to respond and make requests for a small city is incredibly interesting and useful. I believe allowing people to speak their mind and request to make changes in their community is exactly what is great about the United States and the internet.
One idea I had for Gonzaga specifically, is reform in the dining halls. I believe students who eat at the dining hall should have say in what they are served. People are becoming more and more picky in their diets and nutritional needs. And the cog and cataldo dining halls are pretty strict on what they will serve to their students. We do not get too much of a say in their operations. So, my idea is that we create a forum where students can either access a website, or download an app to vote and request what kinds of food is served and how they prepare the food. Not only will this boost student morale, by creating their eating experiences more enjoyable, but it will also create a healthier student population and output in the classroom.
The topic Dr. Dang was talking about in the first few weeks of the semester really opened this idea up to me. Using the work of your customers to tell you what they want, within reasonable efforts and ethics, we can create a more desirable eating environment.
Another topic I found interest in was the idea of using HTML to create your own website. In this new day and age, marketing yourself has become incredibly important if you want to be seen or known. So having Dr. Dang take us through the process of making a personalized website was incredibly important. The HTML process was much more complex than I had thought, so this class opened me up to how the internet actually works. I know I have much more to learn in the realm of online website creation but with practice and diligence I know I can master this, with the help of Dr. Dang. Now that the workforce is becoming much more online and working remotely is not as rare, I can expect to learn much more about working with online tools such as HTML, Python, and SQL. It is unreasonable to think that you will never have to use these tools, so better to start learning ow to use them now so by the time we are working and providing for ourselves, we will be apt to work efficiently online.
